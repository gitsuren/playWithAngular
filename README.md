Let's more about Angular 8 and also the angular 8 testing with KARMA and JASMINE

1. The project angular8-springboot-client is the angular 8 CRUD app where it connects to backend service running on springboott2. Complete app is here : https://github.com/gitsuren/Spring-Boot-Angular-8-CRUD-Example 
I took the reference of or it is forked from https://github.com/mehulk05/Spring-Boot-Angular-8-CRUD-Example and did some ncecessary modifications

```


FOR RUNNING THE TESTS:
you can run one of the following:

```console
ng test --watch
npm run test
yarn run test
```

All above will run the ng test - --watch will run in watch mode with realtime testing 

YARN is another dependency management tool like npm. Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

IN MAC to install, you can simply run:
```console
brew install yarn
brew upgrade yarn
yarn --version
```
